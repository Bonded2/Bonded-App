# Bonded - Relationship Verification for Immigration Success

> **Privacy-first relationship verification app for visa and residency applications. AI runs fully in-browser. Storage on ICP blockchain.**


## üéØ Overview

**Bonded** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps couples collect, organize, and present evidence of their genuine relationship for immigration applications. Built with privacy-first principles, all AI processing happens in-browser, and data is encrypted before storage on the Internet Computer blockchain.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- ü§ñ **In-Browser AI Filtering** - Face detection, NSFW filtering, and text classification
- üîê **End-to-End Encryption** - 2-of-3 threshold cryptography with client-side encryption
- üì± **Offline-First PWA** - Works without internet, syncs when connected
- üîó **Smart Integrations** - Telegram messages, photo library scanning, document OCR
- üìä **Timeline View** - Chronological evidence with filtering and search
- üìÑ **PDF Export** - Visa-ready evidence packages for immigration officers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy by Design** - No sensitive data ever leaves your device unencrypted

- **Service Worker** for offline functionality and background sync
- **IndexedDB** for local storage and evidence queuing
- **WebCrypto API** for client-side encryption

### Backend (ICP Rust Canisters)
- **Evidence Canister** - Encrypted evidence storage and retrieval
- **Relationship Canister** - Partner linking and threshold key management
- **Auth Canister** - User authentication and session management
- **Settings Canister** - User preferences and configuration
- **Audit Canister** - Transparent action logging

### AI Models (Client-Side)
- **YOLOv5 Nano** - Face detection and human presence verification
- **NSFWJS** - Content filtering for appropriate evidence
- **DistilBERT** - Text classification for message filtering
- **Tesseract.js** - OCR for document text extraction

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **DFX** (DFINITY Canister SDK) 0.15+
