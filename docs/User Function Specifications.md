# User Function Specifications

| User | Function | UI/UX | Processing |
|------|----------|-------|------------|
| Client A/B | **F01. Open App** | Bonded logo with the standard login options. I.e. (i) email-id/password entry, or (ii) Internet Identity, or (iii) by a biometric depending on the smartphone settings the user has chosen. E.g, if the device provides the appropriate facility, there will be an option to select 'use face recognition'.<br><br>As usual, there is an option to register by entering email-id and a new password if not already registered. | If the user has not previously completed registration the app undergoes the usual process of sending a link or code to the provided email-id for the user to complete the registration. Includes tick-a-box for terms and conditions. On registering, the user is assigned an internal USER-ID (takes the same format as a cryptographic key – i.e. a 32-byte number).<br><br>User's credentials are checked and if OK the user is sent to the next screen.<br><br>If the user has not yet completed KYC, the next screen is the Main Screen. Otherwise the next screen is the KYC screen. |
| Client A/B | **F02. KYC** | There will be several options for undergoing KYC. The user can select one depending on the jurisdiction of the visa provider:<br>- iProov<br>- Yoti<br>- Onfido<br><br>The app will interface with the third party function to undergo the KYC procedure. After this step the app goes to the Main Screen. | Although the user remains within the Bonded app, in the background the third party process is operating – for example, the user taking and uploading a selfie, or uploading their passport photo page, etc. |
| Client A/B | **F03. Main Screen** | The main screen displays a scrollable timeline, starting with the most recent relationship evidence at the top (or just a relevant message if there is no data yet). The displayed files (e.g. photo, DM, etc) are accompanied with the 'bonded metadata' (which was added at the time of upload - this metadata is in addition to any embedded metadata such as EXIF files in jpegs).<br><br>At the top left corner is a hamburger menu icon. At top right corner is the ICP canister URL.<br><br>The hamburger menu expands into:<br>- Profile<br>- Settings<br>- Connect to partner<br>- Dashboard<br>- Manual upload<br>- Export to PDF<br>- StoryMaker<br>- ApplicationMaker<br>- Status Assessor | Although the official Evidence Vault is stable memory on an ICP canister, the original files remain on the device. The files have been collated into a 'local vault' in chronological order on the device and this local vault is the source for the on-screen timeline. Note: the app ensures the local vault is synchronised across the two partners' devices).<br><br>If the user selects an option from the list, the app goes to the relevant screen. |
| Client A/B | **F04. Profile** | The user profile is displayed with some of the values modifiable:<br>- User Name<br>- DOB<br>- User IDs (email, II, USER-ID)<br>- Partner name/IDs (if connected)<br>- Relationship-ID (if connected)<br>- (Other standard profile settings) | Any profile elements that were generated by the KYC cannot be changed (e.g. name, DOB, etc). |
| Client A/B | **F05. Settings** | There are settings for:<br>- Image AI filter<br>- Text AI filters<br>- Location filter<br>- Upload cycle<br><br>The beta (MVP) version will display the settings screen(s) but will only allow the default settings. I.e. the display of options is 'FYI' only initially. Eventually there will be sophisticated options for the filters. | The default options are:<br>- Images: reject nudity<br>- Text: exclude sexual content<br>- Location: allow all locations<br>- Upload: daily at local midnight |
| Client A<br>Client B | **F06. Connect to Partner**<br><br>**F06.1 Send Invitation** | The assumption is the partner (Client B, who obviously has already agreed to use the Bonded app) has already downloaded the app.<br><br>One partner can then invite the other to form the relationship entity within Bonded. The invitation can be sent via any of the following partner-IDs:<br>- Email-id<br>- Internet ID<br>- Internal USER-ID<br><br>The app displays the full name of the selected partner and asks for verification before proceeding.<br><br>**F06.2 Accept Invitation**<br><br>Partner gets an alert on device | The app first verifies the selected ID to make sure it exists as a registered user of Bonded. After the inviter verifies the full name of the invitee, the app sends an alert to the invitee.<br><br>The invitee can then open the Bonded app and accept the invitation. On doing so, the app creates a Relationship-ID (also a 32-byte number) |
| Client A/B | **F07. Dashboard** | Status information is displayed:<br>- Partner details (name, ID)<br>- Relationship-ID<br>- Duration since establishment of relationship-ID<br>- Upload history (dates uploaded, success stats, etc)<br>- Number of files in timeline<br>- Files pending upload | |
| Client A/B | **F08. Manual Upload** | The app displays a set of file source options (for example, photo library, DM messages, cloud documents, etc.). The user can select from these and gets a list of the available files.<br><br>For example, if the user subscribes to Dropbox, and selects this option, the app displays the folder/file structure and allows the user to select a file for upload (e.g., a marriage certificate).<br><br>The user gets a prompt to verify the selection. | The various source options have been pre-programmed.<br><br>The app links to the source back-end (e.g. Dropbox) to display the selectable files. Once the user selects a file and verifies the selection, the app retrieves the selected file and adds it to the local vault (as 'pending' status) for later processing (i.e. for encryption and uploading to ICP). |
| Client A/B | **F09. Export to PDF** | This function allows the user to download the timeline to a PDF format, for example, to support a visa application. The user will be able to select the entire timeline to download or a specific time period. | Based on the User entry (e.g. defined time period) the app retrieves the relevant files in chronological order and creates the PDF version of the timeline). |
| Client A/B | **F10. StoryMaker** | The User can use this function to generate a coherent, self-consistent Narrative. The User can select a date range (default=all); select which file types to include (default=all). The output will be displayed on the device and there is an option to generate a PDF version. | The output is more sophisticated than the raw timeline as the evidence is cross-referenced by an on-device LLM (LLaMa 3). For example, if the couple met at a restaurant, the app would accompany that portion of the Narrative with the relevant evidence, such as a DM saying "meet at such-and-such restaurant at 6:30pm" + a photo of the couple at the restaurant + geo-location data. |
| Client A/B | **F11. ApplicationMaker** | The user indicates the specific visa application (e.g. providing the form number and/or website url). The app retrieves the appropriate documents for each step in the application process. | On-device LLM (LLaMa 3) interprets the visa application requirements at each step and matches them against the available stored documents. |
