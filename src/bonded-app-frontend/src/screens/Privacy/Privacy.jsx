          <p>At Bonded, we're committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your data when you use our relationship verification app.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="privacy-heading">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p className="privacy-paragraph">
          <strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you register for Bonded, we collect your email address for account authentication. During setup, you may provide government-issued ID for verification purposes through our secure third-party providers.
        </p>
        
        <p className="privacy-paragraph">
          <strong>Relationship Evidence:</strong> With your permission, Bonded accesses:
        </p>
        <ul className="privacy-list">
          <li>Photos from your device</li>
          <li>Telegram messages between you and your partner</li>
          <li>Geolocation data (optional)</li>
          <li>Documents you manually upload</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div className="privacy-highlight">
          <div className="privacy-highlight-icon">üí°</div>
          <div className="privacy-highlight-content">
            <strong>Important:</strong> All your relationship evidence is processed locally on your device. The actual content of your photos and messages is never transmitted to or stored on our servers. Only encrypted metadata with secure timestamps is stored on the blockchain.
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2 className="privacy-heading">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <p className="privacy-paragraph">We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul className="privacy-list">
          <li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> To establish and maintain your Bonded account</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> To verify your identity for relationship verification</li>
          <li><strong>Relationship Evidence:</strong> To securely timestamp and organize your relationship evidence</li>
          <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> To analyze app performance and improve our services</li>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send important updates about your account or our service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 className="privacy-heading">3. How Your Data is Protected</h2>
        
        <p className="privacy-paragraph">
          <strong>Encryption:</strong> All relationship evidence is encrypted using advanced encryption standards. Your data is protected by a unique encryption key that only you and your partner can access through a secure threshold mechanism.
        </p>
        
        <p className="privacy-paragraph">
          <strong>Blockchain Security:</strong> We use the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain to securely timestamp your relationship evidence. This provides immutable proof of the existence of your evidence at specific points in time without exposing the actual content.
        </p>
        
        <p className="privacy-paragraph">
          <strong>Local Processing:</strong> Sensitive data processing (like photo filtering) happens locally on your device, not on our servers. This significantly reduces privacy risks.
        </p>
        
        <div className="privacy-highlight">
          <div className="privacy-highlight-icon">üîê</div>
          <div className="privacy-highlight-content">
            <strong>Zero Knowledge Design:</strong> Bonded is designed with "zero knowledge" principles. We cannot access the actual content of your relationship evidence, even if compelled by law enforcement or court orders.
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2 className="privacy-heading">4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>

          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Who help us deliver specific functions of our service</li>
